FSM is a demo-cum-experience facility in North India, vests in extensive skill building, MSME consultancy, multi-academia partnerships and research which will give a huge fillip to technology aided competitiveness of Indian manufacturing. The project will imbibe technologies from Europe, Japan, USA and India. 'Producing Smarter' with Technologies. FSM has been launched specifically for implementation of smart manufacturing in India which it undertakes to do effectively by: Awareness Building, Prototyping, Simulation and testing Services, Consulting Services, Site Integration Services, Education and Training, Skills Certification, Job work and Research.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.iafsm.in/index.php/about-us'}),\n",
